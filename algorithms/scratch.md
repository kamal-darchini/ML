**Fisher Test:**

Find probability of the current setting. Add other setting toward the assumption. Final probability defines significance of the assumption.

**T-test:**

Assumes mean of samples from a distribution is Normally distributed around the mean f the distibution. Once t value is determined (normalized variation from mean of distribution, or normalized difference between mean of two samples), a table can give p-value. Very small p-value will reject null-hypothesis, which is mean of samples are equal.
